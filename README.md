openrave_plugin
===============
openrave_plugin is a utility package that simplifies packaging of
[OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/) models, plugins, and databases assets in a
Catkin workspace. This package defines a Catkin [environment
hook](http://docs.ros.org/fuerte/api/catkin/html/environment.html) that adds
these paths to your `OPENRAVE_DATA`, `OPENRAVE_DATABASES`, and
`OPENRAVE_PLUGINS` environment variables.
